# Disaster Response Pipeline Project

### About the Project

The goal of this project is an interactive webapp that is able to classify messages sent from areas in which natural disasters occured.
The classification algorithm used is pretrained using a labeled dataset that consist of more than 20.000 messages and X possible labels. 


### Instructions:
1. Run the following commands in the project's root directory to set up your database and model.

    - To run ETL pipeline that cleans data and stores in database
        `python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/DisasterResponse.db`
    - To run ML pipeline that trains classifier and saves
        `python models/train_classifier.py data/DisasterResponse.db models/classifier.pkl`

2. Run the following command in the app's directory to run your web app.
    `python run.py`

3. Go to http://0.0.0.0:3001/
